# HBase Sink with support for dynamic schema

HBase sink with support for dynamic schema

## Usage Notes

## Configuration

## Build

To build your plugins:

    mvn clean package -DskipTests

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory for wrangler-transform and .jar for wrangler-service application. These files can be used to deploy your plugins and wrangler backend.


## Deployment
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/hbase-sink-dynamic-schema-<version>.jar> config-file <target/hbase-sink-dynamic-schema-<version>.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'hbase-sink-dynamic-schema-<version>':

    > load artifact target/hbase-sink-dynamic-schema-<version>.jar config-file target/hbase-sink-dynamic-schema-<version>.json
